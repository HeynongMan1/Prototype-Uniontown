		<div>As mask mandates are lifted in Texas and other states and as U.S. COVID-19 case counts dip, Uniontown Hospital critical care physician Anas Wardeh worries, despite President Joe Biden’s assurance that vaccine will be available for every American by May.
</div>
		<div>The disease is still here, he said. The deaths continue.
</div>
		<div>“The battle is ongoing,” said Dr. Wardeh, 55, who oversees the ICU. “Nothing can stop it. We’re fighting against the odds.”

Last year was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with COVID-19 killing 400,000 people. The fatalities have since grown to 527,000 as more lethal variants of the virus have arisen.


At Uniontown Hospital, the prospect of a surge fueled by new strains brings with it the threat of new psychic wounds for caregivers.

</div>
		<div>Still in recovery from a tidal wave of death last December, Uniontown Hospital is bracing for anything and everything when it comes to COVID-19.</div>
		<div>Doctors and nurses pushed back hard.
</div>
		<div>“People dying every day, the unit full every day — I took that home every night. I don’t think the staff could tolerate that again.”
</div>
		<div>Day after day, COVID-19 pounded a small hospital in Fayette County — in December alone claiming more than three-quarters of the total lives lost in the county since the pandemic struck this rural southwest corner of Pennsylvania a year ago.
</div>
		<div>Three months later, the hospital’s intensive care unit is hushed. The second floor — where two round holes were knocked into an outside wall so big blowers on wheels could pump fresh air into a COVID-19 red zone for patients — is again open to visitors. And the visitors’ elevator is stopping again on the second floor, which it had bypassed during the peak of the outbreak to curb the spread of the disease.
</div>
		<div>“Cardiac arrest after cardiac arrest after cardiac arrest,” recalled intensive care unit charge nurse Michelle Weaver, 48. 
</div>
		<div>The worry now is whether the staff will be strong enough to beat back the next wave — one many experts are worried may come — of a disease that kills four of every five people who become seriously ill.
</div>
		<div>Scroll</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Doctors and nurses worry about the next crush of patients with COVID-19.</div>
		<div>Uniontown Hospital was crowded with people struggling to breathe.</div>
		<div>“I never want anyone to die by themselves.”
Michelle Weaver, ICU nurse
</div>
		<div>More Fayette County residents died in December from COVID-19 than the other 11 months combined.</div>
